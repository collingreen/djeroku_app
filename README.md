# Djeroku_app

djeroku_app is the django application that drives the official
[djeroku.com](http://djeroku.com) site. It is a very simple
bootstrap / html5 boilerplate hybrid with a couple extra
views and files that demonstrate things like custom 404/500
pages and using the task queue on heroku.

Check out the [djeroku project](https://github.com/collingreen/djeroku)
for more info.
